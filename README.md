# Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier

We will use some of the algorithms specifically:

1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score
